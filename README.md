# websocket
Run the PHP server:

Start the PHP WebSocket server by running php websocket_server.php in your terminal. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to bind to the port and run the server.
Open the client in a browser:

Save the HTML code in a file, say index.html, and open it in your web browser. The client will connect to the WebSocket server running on ws://localhost:8765.
Send messages:

You can now send messages through the input box on the client, and the server will echo back the messages.
This setup will allow you to establish a WebSocket connection between a PHP server and a JavaScript client without using third-party libraries.
